# IMERG Frequency Analysis

This repository contains a (very limited amount) of my work for NASA, but it should give a taste of what my project was about. 

In short, my project focused on improving a statistical modeling framework based on IMERG precipitation data. I applied an alternative methodology for the regional modeling based on the correlations of certain clustering variables with the cluster homogeneity of extreme precipitation and a coordinate hyperparameter search for clustering weights.
